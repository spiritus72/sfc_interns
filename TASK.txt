This is the list of tasks of the second phase of the recruitment process for the intern position:

https://wiki.opnfv.org/display/DEV/Intern+Project%3A+kubernetes-sfc+scenario+investigation+and+prototype

Here is the list of tasks:

#1 - Create a github account (if you don't have one yet) and fork this repo. We would like you to write down the answers of the questions we ask in the forked version of this text file. If the task requires some practical exercises, we would like you to write every command you use

Answer#1 - Done

#2 - Set up the VPN to connect to our lab. To do so, read the instructions in the next link under the section "Using the VPN":

https://wiki.opnfv.org/display/INF/Lab-as-a-Service+at+the+UNH-IOL

Your username and password for the VPN were provided to you in the mail

Answer#2 - Done

#3 - Connect to our server (10.10.100.21) using ssh with username opnfv and the same for password

Answer#3 - Done: ssh opnfv@10.10.100.21

#4 - How would you ssh our server without having to write the password? If you know a way, apart from briefly explaining how, please try to do it. HINT: Restarting the sshd process (ssh server) is not needed

Answer#4 - Thanks for the hint :)

    In order to ssh the server without having to write the password I'll have to generate an SSH Keypair which will allow me to identify myself without using a password.
    
    First I will create my SSH Keypair by running ssh-keygen on my local machine and this will create an id_rsa and id_rsa.pub file.
    
    Next I copy the public key to the server with ssh-copy-id. It'll prompt for the SSH password you gave me, when I type it and if all completes successfully I'll be able to access the server via ssh opnfv@10.10.100.21 without needing a             password.
    
    ##Practical steps
    
	  ######################################################################
      spiritus@spiritus-HP-ProBook-450-G4:~$ ssh-keygen
      spiritus@spiritus-HP-ProBook-450-G4:~$ ssh-copy-id opnfv@10.10.100.21
      spiritus@spiritus-HP-ProBook-450-G4:~$ ssh opnfv@10.10.100.21
      ######################################################################
      
      Now you can login without typing a password :)

#5 - ssh to your VM running in the server. The ip was provided in the mail

Answer#5 - Done: ssh root@192.168.122.3

#6 - How would you ssh directly from your computer to the VM without having to use ssh twice (one to connect to the server and another one to connect to the VM)? If you know a way, apart from briefly explaining how, please try to do it.

Answer#6 - There are two ways I know of accessing the VM without having to use ssh twice; 
	The first one is to use a ProxyCommand in my SSH config:
		create an SSH configuration file in my home directory, `~/.ssh/config`
		
		###########################################################################
		Hostname 10.10.100.21    # IP address to the address of the "middleserver"
		User opnfv         # Change this default user accordingly 

		Host 192.168.122.3    # IP address of the target host
		ProxyCommand ssh -q 10.10.100.21 nc -q0 192.168.122.3
		###########################################################################
		
		Then I can access the machine using ssh opnfv@192.168.122.3
		
	OR
	
	I can just upgrade to OpenSSH version 7.3 (released in August 2016) and access the machine using
	ssh -J root@192.168.122.3 opnfv@10.10.100.21
	
	Note: To upgrade to OpenSSH version 7.3 in Ubuntu 16.04 I had to install and compile from source.

#7 - Install docker inside the VM

#8 - Create 2 docker containers (use opensuse or ubuntu as their operating system) making sure that they don't stop when you leave them. From now on, we will call these containers: container1 and container2

#9 - Make sure you can ping between both containers

#10 - Explain what are the used networking protocols and the exchanged packets that appear in order for ping to be successful (e.g. container2 first sends a UDP packet with the IP of container 1...)

#11 - Describe in detail what is the path the packets follow since they leave the interface inside container1 until they reach the interface inside container2

#12 - Imagine, container1 and container2 are in different VMs or servers. What do you think would change from what you described in #11?

#13 - Push this file with the answers to your private github repository

#14 - Send an email to Dimitris and Manuel with a link to the document in your github repo


Please contact Dimitris or Manuel if you get stuck in any of the steps
